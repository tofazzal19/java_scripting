This code is using nested loops to iterate through a two-dimensional array (bigarr). Here are the steps that the code goes through:

The outer loop is initialized with i=0. It will iterate as long as i is less than the length of bigarr.
For each iteration of the outer loop, the code will execute the console.log statement, which will output the inner array at index i.
The inner loop is then initialized with j=0. It will iterate as long as j is less than the length of the inner array at index i.
For each iteration of the inner loop, the code will execute the console.log statement, which will output the element at index j of the inner array at index i.
Once the inner loop has finished iterating, the outer loop will move on to the next element in bigarr and repeat steps 2-4 until all elements in bigarr have been processed.
So, when this code is executed with the bigarr array defined as [[1,2,3], [2,3,4], [7,7,7]], the output will be:
